#summary The different components of Djapian

= Foreword =

To better understand how Djapian works, it is suggested to read how Xapian itself works first. You can look at [http://www.xapian.org/docs/ Xapian's documentation], especially at
the [http://www.xapian.org/docs/quickstart.html quickstart], the [http://www.xapian.org/docs/glossary.html glossary] and the [http://www.xapian.org/docs/overview.html overview].

= Djapian's architecture =

Djapian is a program divided in three parts :
 * The Djapian backend, which is used to describe the index to create and to search in this index;
 * The Djapian Django application, which describe model used to monitor the changes on the model to index;
 * The run_djapian.py daemon, used to monitor the changes on Django's database and to update the index accordingly.

== The backend ==

== The Django application ==

== The deamon ==

The daemon monitors the table djapian_change (defined in the models.py file of Djapian) at every 10 seconds (configurable) and update the index when an entry is found in the table.

To invoke the deamon, the DJANGO_SETTINGS_MODULE variable must be set. Here is an invocation example :
