In order to set who must be indexed, you have to add some lines into your `models.py`, just like follows.

Lets get this model as example:

{{{
from django.db import models

class Page(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField()
    content = models.TextField()

}}}

To index this model, you have to create an `djapian.indexer.Indexer` instance, but first, lets import the class:

{{{
from django.db import Model
from djapian.indexer import Indexer 
}}}

And now, we create the `Indexer` instance (but, just after the `class Page`):
{{{
class Page(models.Model):
    title = models.CharField()
    content = models.TextField()

page_indexer = Indexer(
    model = Page, # What model will be indexed
    fields = [
        'title',
        'content'
    ], # The fields in the model to index
    tags = [ # The prefixed fields, more information in IndexerClass page
        ('title','title')
    ]
)
}}}

Look at IndexerClass to advanced configuration of `Indexer` instance.

*Note*: You can create as many `Indexer` instances as you wish, but not (yet?) more than one model per `Indexer`.

After configure the `models.py`, you can put the whole thing to work by RunningTheIndexer
