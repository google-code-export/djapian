To install Djapian you'll need [InstallingXapian Xapian] installed and a [http://subversion.tigris.org subversion] client.

== Download Djapian ==
Currently the only way to install Djapian is from the source in the SVN repository, I don't know why, but when I run `python setup.py sdist` on my machine it does not add the `backend` module in the package, but the install option do.

{{{
svn co http://djapian.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ djapian
}}}

== Install Djapian ==

Enter in the djapian directory created and type
{{{
python setup.py install
}}}

If you are using a shared server you can also pass a `--prefix=/path/to/your/home/python-2.X` and after set this as part of your PYTHONPATH (e.g. in the Apache configuration file or your settings.py file)

Done, you now can use djapian, don't forget to [RunDjapian execute the `run_djapian.py`]
