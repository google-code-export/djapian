#summary How to run the indexer
#labels Phase-Deploy

After setup the project and configure the models, you just need to run:
 `python manage.py index`

And it will wait for changes in the models and update the index database

You can also use those options:

 * `--verbosity` - Will print every change into the database (default: No)
 * `--daemonize` - Fork the process to background, avoid use with `--verbosity` or your terminal will be useless (default: No)
 * `--time-out` - Time to wait before each verification for updates (default: 10)
 * `--rebuild` - Erase the database and starts a new one
