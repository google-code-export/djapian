#summary How to use stemming (searching for the root of a word)

= Introduction =

Stemming is the action of reducing a word to it's root. For instance, the words connection, connections,
connective, connected and connecting can all be reduced to a common root "connect". For more
information, see [http://www.xapian.org/docs/stemming.html this document].

This feature is available in Djapian since SVN revision 67.

= Stemming in Djapian =

To use stemming in Djapian, you must first define a variable in the settings.py file of your Django project:

{{{
# For a complete list of supported languages, see :
# http://www.xapian.org/docs/apidoc/html/classXapian_1_1Stem.html#d4adbe1617ce7c54c3aa7d3d67d407bd
DJAPIAN_STEMMING_LANG = "en"
}}}

That's all there is to do. When Djapian detects the DJAPIAN_STEMMING_LANG is defined, it will use stemming when indexing the documents, and will stem the search query.

*Important* : For stemming to work, the index must be build with stemming enabled. You may have to rebuild your index if it was not build with stemming.

For now, Djapian supports only one language for stemming. Per-document language support will be added soon.
